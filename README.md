# rock-paper-scissors

This app is built using HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript.  
  
The app first displays a form asking for some basic information such as the name and age of the player, and their favorite color as well.  
  
When the form is correctly submitted, it will disappear and be replaced by the game, customized with the name, age, and color the user entered.  
  
The user will play with the computer, multi-round. The app will also keep track of the score.
